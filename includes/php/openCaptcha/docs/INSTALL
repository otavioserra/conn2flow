OpenCaptcha v1.1
INSTALL
=======

Requirements
------------
This script has been tested with PHP 4.4.4 and PHP 5.20.
The gd library and png support must be present in your version of PHP

instructions
------------

1. Unpack opencaptcha.tar.gz and place it in the same directory as the 
   form you wish to protect.

2. The form that OpenCaptcha is to protect must be a php page, and must
   have an active session. If it is not currently a php page, add the
   following line to the top of the script:

   <?php session_start(); ?>

   Then, rename the script using the .php extension.

3. To have the captcha image display on the screen place this code where
   you want it to appear:

   <img src = "/path/to/captcha.php" alt = "Security Image" />

   You must also add a text field for the user to enter the captcha text.
   This is just a regular input field.

4. OpenCaptcha uses the session variable $_SESSION['captchaText'] to hold
   the text in the captcha image. In the page that your form points to,
   place the following code:

   <?php
   session_start();
   if ($_SESSION['captchaText'] != $_RESULT['theNameofYourTextField']){
      echo "Incorrect captcha text entered.";
   }
   ?>

   You obviously want to do more than display an error message like this,
   but this is the general idea.

   After you've verified that the captcha string was correctly entered,
   it is necessary to unset the $_SESSION['captchaText'] variable in
   case you want to use it again during the current session.  To do this
   use the following code after your validation:

   <?php
   unset($_SESSION['captchaText']);
   ?>

5. Configure OpenCaptcha to your specifications by editing the configuration
   section of captcha.php.

   $minStringLength - This is used to set the minimum length of the captcha
      string.

   $maxStringLength - This is used to set the maximum length of the captcha
      string.

   $fontPath - The path were your true type fonts are stored.  Only .ttf files
      will work with OpenCaptcha.  The fonts included with OpenCaptcha have
      been released under the GPL by http://www.dustismo.com/.

   $backgroundPath - The path were your backgrounds are stored.  Backgrounds
      must be valid .png files and should be an appropriate size to fit the
      captcha text, otherwise you will get an undesireable result.

   $angle - OpenCaptcha can write text to the image at an angle.  Straight
      text requires a value of 0. For angled text, choose a value between 0 and
      90.  If $angle is set to 20, the offset used could be anywhere between
      -20 and 20.

   $captchaCharacters - This string is a list of characters that the captcha text
      will be chosen from.  Be careful about using some symbols that may be too
      difficult to distinguish between.

   $caseSensitive - If set to true, OpenCaptcha will set the random captcha string
      to all UPPERCASE.  Make sure your script does the same to make it case-
      insensitive.

   $minFontSize - The minimum font size. Some fonts may not be readable if this
      value is set too low. To set a specific font size make $minFontSize and
      $maxFontSize the same value.  This value must be greater than 10.

   $maxFontSize - The maximum font size. Some fonts may not be readable if this
      value is set too low. To set a specific font size make $minFontSize and
      $maxFontSize the same value.  This value must be greater than 10.

   $minLines - OpenCaptcha can draw "interference" line across the image in random
      places from top to bottom.  This value determines the minimum number of
      lines to draw.  To draw no lines, use 0 for this value and $maxLines.  Be
      careful not to draw too many lines or the captcha will be unreadable.

   $maxLines - OpenCaptcha can draw "interference" line across the image in random
      places from top to bottom.  This value determines the maximum number of
      lines to draw.  To draw no lines, use 0 for this value and $minLines.  Be
      careful not to draw too many lines or the captcha will be unreadable.

   $shadow - OpenCaptcha can create a shadow behind the text.  To get this effect,
      set this value to true.

   $shadowOffsetX - This value determines how wide the shadow appears.  This will
      have no effect if $shadow is set to false.

   $shadowOffsetY - This value determines how wide the shadow appears.  This will
      have no effect if $shadow is set to false.
