v1.2

*	Replaced some of the default backgrounds because it was too
	difficult to read text from in some cases.

*	Captcha images no longer need to be saved to disk. They are
	output directly to the page.

*	Added a refresh javascript function, so that if the user can't 
	read the captcha text from the image, the can request a new one 
	without reloading the page and losing information on the form.
