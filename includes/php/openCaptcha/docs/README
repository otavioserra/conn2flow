OpenCaptcha v1.1
================

OpenCaptcha is a php script designed to dynamically
create a captcha image in .png form.  It uses a
randomly chosen background, a randomly chosen string
of a randomly chosen length, color, size, and orientation,
along with randomly coloured and placed lines to create
an image that only a human can interpret.

Disclaimer
----------
Do not use this script as the only means of authentication.
No captcha image is 100% effective.  Given enough time and
programming, even the most difficult captcha image can be
interpreted by a computer.

To ensure the maximum effectiveness of this script, combine
it with a timer and a "maximum-tries" routine.
