TODO
====

1.	Specify text colours. Sometimes the text colour is too similar to
	the background colour causing it to be difficult to read.

2.	Text displayed out of bounds.  Occasionally, the text will get 
	cut off at the edge of the image.  This isn't supposed to happen, 
	and will be fixed in the next major version.

3.	Ability for each character to have a different font, colour, 
	angle, and position.
