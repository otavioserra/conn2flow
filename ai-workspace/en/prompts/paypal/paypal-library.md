# Prompt Interactive Programming - Create PayPal Library

## 📝 Main Objective
Create a library aimed at facilitating integration with the PayPal REST API, allowing developers to perform operations such as creating payments, querying transactions, and managing subscriptions in a simplified way. This library will be consumed by various modules of the Conn2Flow system that require online payment functionalities.

## 📝 Guidelines for the Agent
1. Analyze the PayPal documentation to get the general context of the REST API: `https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/`.
2. The library file was previously created at `gestor\bibliotecas\paypal.php`. Include the entire library in this file. If it becomes larger than expected, create separate files in the same location using the following format: `gestor\bibliotecas\paypal\{filename}.php` and include them in `gestor\bibliotecas\paypal.php` which will be the library index.
3. Use the following library as a coding standard for code formatting and comments: `gestor\bibliotecas\oauth2.php`.
4. If you have doubts or suggestions at any time, include your considerations right in the next session as I will always be available to help and resolve any impasse.
