# Understand Conn2Flow Resources
- Resources are the versioned, database‑synced content that drive `pages`, `layouts`, `components`, `variables` and other system abstracts entities. They consist of metadata (JSON) and optional physical files (HTML/CSS/MD etc) stored under `gestor/resources` or `gestor/modulos/{module}/resources` and are identified by their folder name and files names `{resource-id}/{resource-id}.html|css|md`.
- Developers edit the source files and agents as well, then run the resource compiler (`atualizacao-dados-recursos.php`) which produces `*Data.json` (`EntityIdData.json`) packages stored at `gestor/db/data`. These JSONs are committed alongside the source and later imported into the database by the updater (`atualizacoes-banco-de-dados.php`).
- There are **global** resources (shared across the system) and **module‑scoped** resources (available by user permissions). Languages are handled by separate subfolders (`pt-br`, `en`, etc.).
- The **global** resources stores both metadata (JSON) and optional physical files (HTML/CSS/MD etc) under `gestor/resources/{language}/`. Metadata system entities and records of it are stored under `gestor/resources/{language}/{resource-entity}.json` and physical files under `gestor/resources/{language}/{resource-entity}/{resource-id}/{resource-id}.html|css|md`.
- All the **module‑scoped** resources metadata (JSON) are stored under same file `gestor/modulos/{module}/{module}.json`. Inside this file has one field named `resources` which stores all the system entities and records metadata. They are separated by language `resources.{language}` and entities `resources.{language}.{resource-entity}`. The physical files otherwise are under `gestor/modulos/{module}/resources/{language}/{resource-entity}/{resource-id}/{resource-id}.html|css|md`.
- Any `{resource-id}` and its files have one record in the JSON with the same `{resource-id}` inside the entity `{resource-entity}` to be processed by the system. Otherwise will be ignored and not processed.
- The lifecycle is: create/edit physical files → create/edit the metadata JSON → execute the task `🛠️ Manager - Update => All - Test Environment` inside the file `.vscode\tasks.json`. This task executes 3 operations: run the resource compiler in this repo (`atualizacao-dados-recursos.php`), syncronize all files with the test live environment (docker image info `dev-environment\docker\docker-compose.yml`) and then imported into the database by the updater and updates all resources in it (`atualizacao-dados-recursos.php`).
- It's always needed make versions of resources in all languages available (`pt-br` and `en`). Generally in `pt-br` first, then copy to `en` and translate the content. But the user can prompt more languages if needed. Do not translate the `id` and other fields in the metadata like `type`, `layout`, `path`, `type`, `option`, `target`, `modulo`, etc. Only translate the content fields like: `name`, `value` and `description`. 
- You can translate all the content values of physical files like HTML, CSS, MD, etc. But do not translate the file names and folder names of the resources, they must be the same in all languages and must be the same as the `id` field in the metadata JSON. Prefer uses `en` to create identifiers, but if exists in `pt-br` mantain. And do not translates classes and other technical identifiers in the content of physical files, only the text content that is visible to the user.
- You do not need to fill `checksum` field, only include the field itself blank, they will be automatically filled by the resource compiler. Same for the `version` field, but if it dosen't exist, you need to include it with the value `1.0` for the first version and then update will increment it automatically when compile.
- For learn more information about what Resources are in Conn2Flow, look at the documentation file `ai-workspace\en\docs\CONN2FLOW-RESOURCES-SYSTEM.md`, and also in `gestor/resources` or `gestor/modulos/{module}/resources` folders to see examples of resources.
