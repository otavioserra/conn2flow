# Modification Planning

I have placed the following files in your context. First, let's start the planning process. You will modify the last file in the list below, with all the steps and modification needs given our conversation here and the next interactions. Finally, when we finish planning all modifications, I will authorize you to start the implementation.

1. Original implementation: `PATH`.
2. Planning used in this original implementation: `PATH`.
3. Planning model of the current modification that we will use as a planning document: `PATH`.

## IMPORTANT: 
1. There are plenty of references above. Including within the mentioned files. Inside them there is valuable information that can help in the implementation.
2. Do not rush, we can use several interactions to refine the planning.
3. I will be attentive to the modifications you will make in the main planning file.

I will pass you in this and the next interactions the necessary tasks for the modification.

Initial task: 

Therefore, let's start the planning.
