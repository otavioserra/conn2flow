# Conn2Flow CMS - Open Source

**Welcome to Conn2Flow CMS!**

Conn2Flow is a lightweight and flexible open-source Content Management System (CMS) built using LAMP technology (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP). Originally developed as a proprietary CMS named B2make, Conn2Flow is now being released to the open-source community to foster collaboration and innovation.

*Online Demos*

You will be able to experience Conn2Flow in two demo versions:

* Latest Version (app.conn2flow.com):  [app.conn2flow.com](http://app.conn2flow.com) (not yet online) - This is the current version of Conn2Flow, developed with Git and representing the latest project state.
* Legacy Version (v1.conn2flow.com): [v1.conn2flow.com](http://v1.conn2flow.com) (not yet online) - This is the legacy version of Conn2Flow, based on the original B2make developed with Tortoise CVS. It is provided for demonstration and historical reference purposes.

*Getting Started*

To run Conn2Flow locally, you will need a configured LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) environment.

*Basic Steps*:

1. Clone the repository:*** (Once the public Git repository is published, the link will be inserted here)
 git clone [GIT_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE]
2. Configure the Database:***
 Create a MySQL database for Conn2Flow.
 Import the database schema (if provided, or follow the installation instructions in the future documentation).
* Configure the database access credentials in the Conn2Flow configuration file (usually in a file like `config.php` or similar).
3. Configure the Web Server (Apache):***
 Configure a Virtual Host in Apache to point to the Conn2Flow project root folder.
 Ensure Apache has the correct permissions to access the project files.
4. Access via Browser:***
 Open your browser and access the address configured in the Virtual Host (e.g., `http://localhost/conn2flow` or the domain you configured).
 Follow the installation/configuration instructions that appear on the screen (if any).

*Versioning*

This Git repository contains the following main branches:

* `main` (or `master`): Main branch with the latest and active version of Conn2Flow. Continuous development will occur in this branch.
* `v1-legacy`: Branch containing the old version of Conn2Flow (based on the original B2make with Tortoise CVS). This branch is provided for reference and demonstration of the legacy version.
