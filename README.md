   **Linux/macOS:**
   ```bash
   curl -L -o instalador.zip https://github.com/otavioserra/conn2flow/releases/download/instalador-v1.5.2/instalador.zip
   ```

   **Windows PowerShell:**
   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/otavioserra/conn2flow/releases/download/instalador-v1.5.2/instalador.zip" -OutFile "instalador.zip"
   ```

   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   LATEST=$(gh release list --repo otavioserra/conn2flow | grep "instalador-v" | head -n1 | awk '{print $3}')
   wget "https://github.com/otavioserra/conn2flow/releases/download/${LATEST}/instalador.zip"

   # Windows PowerShell
   $latest = (gh release list --json tagName | ConvertFrom-Json | Where-Object { $_.tagName -like "instalador-v*" } | Select-Object -First 1).tagName
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/otavioserra/conn2flow/releases/download/$latest/instalador.zip" -OutFile "instalador.zip"
   ```
   **Releases Page:**
   - Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/otavioserra/conn2flow/releases) and download the latest **Instalador** release (look for `instalador-v*` tags, not the "Latest" badge which points to the Gestor system).

2. **Extract to Your Web Directory**
   ```bash
   unzip instalador.zip -d /path/to/your/webroot/gestor-instalador/
   # Or install directly to webroot. The installer is smart enough to detect whether it is in the root or sub-folders.
   unzip instalador.zip -d /path/to/your/webroot/
   ```

3. **Run the Web Installer**

### 🚀 Quick Start for Developers

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/otavioserra/conn2flow.git
   cd conn2flow
   ```

2. **Install VS Code Extensions** (Recommended)
   - **Task Explorer**: `https://github.com/spmeesseman/vscode-taskexplorer` - For easy access to development tasks
   - This extension provides a visual interface for the pre-configured tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json`

3. **Configure Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Copy and configure environment settings
   cp dev-environment/templates/environment/environment.json dev-environment/data/environment.json
   
   # Edit the file with your local paths:
   # - source: Path to your local Conn2Flow installation
   # - target: Path where Docker will mount the files
   # - dockerPath: Internal Docker container path
   ```

4. **Configure Development of Plugins** (if developing plugins)
   ```bash
   # Copy environment files to plugin directories
   cp -r dev-plugins/templates/environment/* dev-plugins/plugins/private/
   cp -r dev-plugins/templates/environment/* dev-plugins/plugins/public/
   
   # Configure environment.json files in both directories with correct paths
   # These files are essential for plugin development scripts to work properly
   ```

3. **Start Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Using Docker (recommended)
   cd dev-environment
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Or use local development scripts
   bash ai-workspace/en/scripts/dev-environment/setup.sh
   ```

4. **Develop Plugins**
   ```bash
   # Use automated templates
   bash dev-plugins/scripts/create-plugin.sh my-plugin
   
   # Development workflow
   cd dev-plugins/plugins/private/my-plugin
   bash scripts/dev/synchronizes.sh checksum
   ```

5. **Contribute to Core**
   ```bash
   # Use AI-assisted development
   # Check ai-workspace/en/prompts/ for standardized templates
   # Follow documented workflows in ai-workspace/en/docs/
   ```

### System Update Mechanism (Automated Updates)

Conn2Flow includes a core update orchestrator in `gestor/controladores/atualizacoes/atualizacoes-sistema.php` with CLI and incremental web (AJAX) support. Main features:

- Artifact download `gestor.zip` by tag (e.g.: `gestor-v1.15.0`) or local artifact usage (`--local-artifact`)
- Optional SHA256 integrity verification (`--no-verify` to skip)
- Selective wipe preserving critical directories: `contents/`, `logs/`, `backups/`, `temp/`, `autenticacoes/`
- Optimized deployment (rename fallback to copy) with statistics of removed/moved files
- Additive merge of `.env` (new variables added with `# added-by-update` block, deprecated variables only logged)
- Unified database script: `atualizacoes-banco-de-dados.php` (applies migrations/data and removes `gestor/db/` folder after success to reduce attack surface)
- JSON plan export + structured logs in `logs/atualizacoes/`
- Execution persistence in `atualizacoes_execucoes` table (status, stats, log/plan links)
- Housekeeping (configurable retention, default 14 days) of logs and temporary directories

Main CLI flags:
```
--tag=gestor-vX.Y.Z  --local-artifact  --only-files  --only-db  --no-db  \
--dry-run  --backup  --download-only  --no-verify  --force-all  --tables=... \
--log-diff  --logs-retention-days=N  --debug
```

Web execution (incremental):
```
?action=start -> deploy -> db -> finalize (status for polling, cancel to cancel)
```
Session state: `temp/atualizacoes/sessions/<sid>.json` + `<sid>.log`.

Complete documentation: `ai-workspace/en/docs/CONN2FLOW-SYSTEM-UPDATES.md`.

### File Ownership & Permissions

To avoid silent failures of `rename()`/`unlink()` during deployment (especially in containers), ensure that the owner of installation directories and artifacts is the same user as the PHP process (e.g.: `www-data`). Example after extraction / before running update:
```bash
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/sites/localhost/conn2flow-gestor
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/sites/localhost/conn2flow-github
```
Permission failures will result in warnings about not removing old folders and files not being updated.

### Modern Development Stack
- **PHP 8.0+**: Modern PHP features and performance
- **Composer**: Dependency management and autoloading
- **Phinx**: Database migrations and schema management
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated builds and releases
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns
