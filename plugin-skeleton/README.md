# Plugin Skeleton

This folder contains the recommended structure for developing, packaging, and releasing plugins for the Conn2Flow system. Below is a detailed breakdown of each directory and file, based on the official plugin architecture and release workflow.

## plugin-templates

This folder (`plugin-templates`) contains all the base files and example structures used to build a new plugin. It serves as a comprehensive template repository, providing ready-to-use examples for every part of a plugin. When creating a new plugin, you can copy files and folders from `plugin-templates` to the actual `plugin` directory, customizing as needed.

**Purpose:**
- Acts as a reference and starting point for plugin development.
- Includes example modules, controllers, resources, and configuration files.
- Ensures consistency and best practices across all plugins.

**Typical contents:**
- Example module structure (`modules/module-id/` with resources, PHP, JS, JSON)
- Example controllers
- Example resource folders and files (layouts, pages, components, variables)
- Example manifest and mapping files

> Use `plugin-templates` as your source for boilerplate code and recommended file organization when starting a new plugin project.

## Key Files & Directories
- **manifest.json**: Required metadata for the plugin.
- **modules/**: Each module must follow the naming and structure for automatic system connection.
- **resources/**: Global resources, with language subfolders and JSON mapping files.
- **db/data/**: Contains Data.json, generated during plugin development.
- **utils/controllers/agents/update-data-resources-plugin.php**: Script to generate Data.json from source files.
- **ai-workspace/scripts/updates/build-local-gestor-plugin.sh**: Script to build and package the plugin for release/testing.
- **.github/workflows/release-gestor-plugin.yml**: GitHub Actions workflow for plugin release automation.

## Usage Notes
- All resource folders (pages, layouts, components) must follow the described structure for compatibility.
- Language folders (e.g., pt-br, en) allow for multi-language resource support.
- Module and global resources are mapped via their respective JSON files and `resources.map.php`.
- The skeleton is designed to support both manual and automated (CI/CD) plugin releases.
